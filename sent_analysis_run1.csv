You have to be prepared to network and work across different functions, personalities and manage the self importance of some senior management. The company does not tolerate poor performance but it can take a year or two before you see action and this can be frustrating. Sometimes we don't live our 'Winning Ways' and we create a bubble in our corporate offices that everything is super when we are not always consistent at hotel level. The hotels don't get to see the impact of a new tool or initiative as we can be too busy creating the next big thing. Be prepared to be part of a matrix organisation where it is difficult to turn the ship around quickly and be responsive to our hotel owners and properties when linking in with non hotel facing colleagues.",0.088037394,0.30683386,0.60512877,Positive Sentiment

The company does not focus on staff welfare, they are more interested in running their staff into the ground for below industry standard wages. There is a large focus on recruiting staff from Eastern Europe, whilst this would not normally bother me it is difficult to manage a team where they do not understand english very well.

When issues are brought up to senior managers, they are dismissed as the company has a 'we're correct, you're wrong' mentality. I am very experienced (possibly more experienced than some of the senior managers) in the hotel industry, having worked in 5 star resorts in the UK and I believe the way this company operates is ridiculous. If you have a look at the tripadvisor comments for most hotels in the company... this is reflected int he poor service that guests receive. 

The company focuses on profit way too much, the current budget cuts (to chase profit may I add) are running staff into the ground and causing them to resign. The company also have an excellent idea of promoting under skilled workers to managerial positions, simply because it is cheaper and they can save money on payroll. 

Unfortunately, this awful company has completely changed my opinion on the industry and I am glad to have left the company and the industry after having been ran into the ground. I'm always looking for ways to develop my career, hence my move to Macdonald Hotels. However, the position was sold to me based on a lie that the company puts its people at the forefront of everything they do.","Negative work environment Quite difficult to stretch this out to the 20 word minimum...

There is a large focus on recruiting staff from Eastern Europe, whilst this would not normally bother me it is difficult to manage a team where they do not understand english very well.

When issues are brought up to senior managers, they are dismissed as the company has a 'we're correct, you're wrong' mentality. I am very experienced (possibly more experienced than some of the senior managers) in the hotel industry, having worked in 5 star resorts in the UK and I believe the way this company operates is ridiculous. If you have a look at the tripadvisor comments for most hotels in the company... this is reflected int he poor service that guests receive. 

The company focuses on profit way too much, the current budget cuts (to chase profit may I add) are running staff into the ground and causing them to resign. The company also have an excellent idea of promoting under skilled workers to managerial positions, simply because it is cheaper and they can save money on payroll. 

Unfortunately, this awful company has completely changed my opinion on the industry and I am glad to have left the company and the industry after having been ran into the ground. I'm always looking for ways to develop my career, hence my move to Macdonald Hotels. However, the position was sold to me based on a lie that the company puts its people at the forefront of everything they do.",0.6611695,0.26488093,0.07394966,Negative Sentiment

I had to take insults regarding my age, my education, my gender and my nationality. Even the Managers from Headquarter and the GMs participated in this matter. There was no possibility to talk to HR as there is no longer HR in this company.

Communication culture is very bad and I was advised by a GM that I would have to â€žpush for thingsâ€œ in this company to get somewhere. Sad that polite and respectful manners were not appreciated.

In general a great company to work for if you would like to learn how not to run a hotel.",0.7444676,0.21045658,0.045075785,Negative Sentiment

Treating guests like a cash cow and misleading them  about the quality and source of their produce.

Common practice for employees to be dismissed for petty reasons with no established legal processes followed. For example, the chairman takes a dislike to someone who serves him so the manager or head of department is told to get rid of that person. 

Staff are constantly worried about losing their jobs so don't stick around for any time at all. Continually recruiting for the same positions

Do you wish to work for a company who, when it all goes wrong, and guests complain, the staff will become the ""whipping boys"" and get the blame, whereas Head Office will hide away and regularly drop you in up to your neck?

I've experienced all of these issues in my time with this bunch of cowboys. I know of personnel diagnosed with Workplace Stress, Depression and other Mental Health issues whilst working for this bunch. Talk to Head Office about it? Not likely, they even refuse to accept these issues exist! I know of ex-personnel now going through Mental Health Therapy, caused in part to the daily Fear etc they'd undergo whilst at work in such a bad environment.

Do you honestly believe all those ""Lovely, Positive &  Glowing Testimonials on here? It's all ""spin"" as Head Office attempt to distance themselves from the negativity, which they don't like at all!!",0.89618444,0.09469045,0.009125127,Negative Sentiment

The autocratic hierarchical company set-up leads to fear trickling down, resulting in each level fearing those above them. Iâ€™ve heard numerous first hand accounts of team members receiving verbal abuse, even in support departments such as Sales. 

Recent changes in the way many hotels work have removed in-house Sales, HR, Accounts and other vital functions - resulting in a them/us culture with Head Office and people selling the hotels to clients who (through next fault of their own) have never visited the hotels and can therefore not sell productively. In what other industry would you have people selling a product which had not been sampled by the people selling it?! Budget restrictions account for a lot of the main problems, but there seems to be a lack of awareness that often investment leads to higher turnover and therefore profit. 

At my particular former property there are individuals in roles who are well known by senior managers to be wholly unsuitable...but a culture of â€˜someone is better than no-oneâ€™ prevails and these people stay and continually under perform. 

There are too many points for me to write here, but in summary - this company is rotten from the top down. Itâ€™s old fashioned approach will be its downfall. There are switched on, business minded people working in each property who are being stripped of any kind of responsibility and whoâ€™s ideas are continually ignored and belittled. There are passionate and talented employees who love what they do leaving because of the toxic environment they find themselves in. Such a shame as there is huge potential at property level which is overlooked to put all the hotel decisions and accountability with Head Office.","So much potential but so many problems Sadly there are none, other than friendships made with colleagues My time with Macdonald Hotels was the most challenging time spent with any hotel group I have ever worked for.

I am a size 20-22 so it's not that hard) which was actually a mans shirt two sizes too big. 

Another con is you sign a contract for a 30 hour work week but they wring 40 hours out of you. They will make you work eight hour days and give you a 20 minute lunch break, which is against the law. They also dictate to you where you eat lunch and won't allow you to leave the premises, like a prisoner. They speak to you like dirt, and the staff are all hostile, rude, angry individuals, with no social skills. They don't follow what you tell them to do as a supervisor, in fact they use the pillow cases that they put on peoples beds to clean the bathrooms and the dirty toilet out with. It's standard practice there and the chambermaids feel it's quicker than using sponges. So no, I'd never sleep on a travelodge pillow if you paid me. It's dirty, the hotel isn't invested in and its full of moths.

But the main issue were the staff. I had one worker tell me she 'felt sorry for me' when I asked why, she replied 'because you're white and british'. This is how they speak to their new trainee managers. It's an atrocious company to work for, I'd never work there again.

On the night shift not much is going on after you have finished your work so you can watch a movie on the side in reception. Managers are not normally around after 6pm so the evening shift is better then the morning and they are never there on the night shifts which can be an added bonus (especially if they are bullies).,"Being asked to cover shifts at the last minute especially by staff that are suddenly leaving, whilst I was there a staff member left every month from a team of receptionists that where only 4 on days and 2 on nights, the entire team refreshed after 6 months. Some hard working and long standing staff members left after they had difficulty getting on to the Aspire course which is Travelodges (training course) and one of only ways to move up the ladder with them. Places are limited and from what I heard whilst being there most people don't get on. I was there for almost a year. 

Wage is minimum and even on promotion it is only Â£1 more. Managers are paid commission so push staff hard to get their key drivers, some of them are lazy so get ready to cover part of there work. 

If you want to get on the course your manager has to put you forward positively so you will have to cover all the extra shifts and awkward shifts to get on the course, quickest you can get on is after about 8 months so be ready for hard work. If a staff member leaves which is inevitable then get ready to work 50/60 hour weeks at awkward times. Another guy that worked there actually said to me he has no life outside of work as he was studying at the same time. Same as me at the time, I was doing a 50 hour week then. 

Your weekends are not yours, they belong to the company and if your manager changes the times and shifts at the last minute then you have no choice but to except even if you have children, this is not the most parent friendly company.  Some managers won't hire until you say you are available for all shifts.  If your a student say which days you can't work in the interview otherwise they won't let you have them off. 

Some managers are not that experienced, few have degrees themselves, this was the case for me. Managers may act aggressively and can start to shout badly, if they do this then don't leave the company, first complain and then leave if that's what you intend on doing, this is because complaints are not taken seriously if you leave and then complain. If they start to shout and bully you complain on the same day, don't wait, unfortunately this happens and is not taken seriously enough. 

Housekeeping/cleaners have the hardest job as they are paid for each room they clean and told they have to do it in 20 mins. Most cannot keep to the times, on busy days they are given more rooms then aloud. It is supposed to be 10 rooms full clean maximum but they often go to 13 with another 2 as service cleans (half cleans). I don't advise you work here as a housekeeper, join another brand. 

Sometimes staff do not have time to clean time fully due to a lack of staff. Travelodge are incredibly penny pinching, they don't take agency staff at all, hence the erratic shifts when someone takes time off. If you have to work Thursday through to Sunday then get ready for a hectic set of shifts, you are unlikely to have enough housekeepers on, and will have too many rooms to clean from my experience.","Full time receptionist Lots of people leaving regularly which meant extra hours available if you want them.

       sleeping or eating in any Travelodge hotel in the country)

â€¢	Some of the team members are hard working and fun to work with.

â€¢	Some of the guests can be really nice friendly people to deal with.","Very low pay compared to other hotels in Central London.  Salary differs quite drastically among the team of AHMâ€™s. 

I was not paid for the first two months of my employment and I had to constantly chase this with HR, and Senior Management who paid little interest or care in the matter.

Huge lack of training for external managers.  Some training will take place but it is no preparation for the job.  You will train on the job, mostly learning from the team members you have to manage.  Once completing â€˜trainingâ€™ you are expected to manage and motivate a team of people who do very demanding and physically tiring, un-rewarding work on very long hours for minimum wage.  

You will be forced to work long unsociable hours without taking breaks and covering shifts for Team Members who donâ€™t turn up.  You will be regularly forced to stay hours past your finish time and work days on end without a day off.  Your body clock will be completely out of sync and it will have a serious effect on your physical and mental health.  Travelodge find it acceptable for you to finish a shift at 11pm and start again the next day at 7am.  If you complain you are told that as a manager you need to be flexible to meet the needs of the business.

Travelodge have a policy of over booking which results in guests arriving late being sent to other hotels.  You are told this doesnâ€™t happen often.  It happens regularly.  This is difficult, not only for the staff but also for the customers.

Head Office are slow to respond when you need them and donâ€™t fully understand the complexities of running a large hotel in Central London.  Mice, bed bugs and flies were regular problems you have to deal with.  Mice running through the dining area is a regular problem as well as mice in rooms and flies on food.  If people complain you offer them a voucher and call pest control who do a temporary fix until next time.  At Covent Garden you deal with drunk people, drug abusers, homeless people, a constant flow of human traffic, its all part of your minimum wage responsibilities.

The only time official policies are followed correctly is when there is a visitor from Head Office or Member of Senior Management in the building.  You then put on your fake smiles and roll out the â€˜goodâ€™ team members and pretend everything is running perfectly.  Health and Safety is atrocious.  Staff are asked to falsify documents by signing check sheets that were never completed in the first place which are then checked by auditors.

There is no structure or accountability for the team of managers.  As a manager once you have trained someone up to do the job well they can become very quickly demotivated and leave as they know they are worth more than a minimum wage job.  Understandably this results in incredibly high staff turnover.  Not just for team members, but managers too.  There was a rotating door of managers coming and going during the 16 months I was there.  During an interview process one of the managers told me we already have enough black people on the team and we should think about that during the interview process.  Needless to say,  HR practices are shocking.  A lot of the staff donâ€™t speak enough English.  They donâ€™t know their rights and do not how to / are too scared to stand up for themselves so are used like slaves working long hours for minimum wage.  Travelodge have a standard way of cleaning rooms via the ten steps.  This doesnâ€™t work in big hotels due to lack of staff and demands to get rooms cleaned as quickly as possible.

Travelodge have created a toxic environment in their flagship hotel and have proven they have no care for the most important part of the hotel â€“ the people!  The main focus of the hotel is Key Drivers and figures, WYR scores and TripAdvisor reviews.  Staff turnover is of no concern to management.  Racial discrimination and bullying tactics are an intrinsic part of Travelodge culture and are accepted as the norm by Senior Management, as long as their targets and bonuses are safe, they are happy.  If you have a conscious, a soul or a shred of humanity, it might be worth applying elsewhere.","Assistant Manager Review â€¢	50% discount of food and room.

We also get 50% off hotel rooms which is incredible! I have stayed in London for the weekend of many occasions for less than Â£100! We also get 50% food and non alcoholic drinks too, 

The management structure is great and there's lots of support, even from your area manager which is very hands on! 

In general I really enjoy working for Travelodge and look forward to a long prosperous career. During peak periods it is extremely busy and under staffed which is frustrating when we cant meet customers needs, this job isn't for the faint hearted!",0.01057621,0.03432809,0.95509565,Positive Sentiment

 The benefits for team members including discount rooms and high street shopping, mamagement advancement courses and pension schemes are great.
 The Aspire Traveller Course, one of the advancement courses I am about to begin is open to all who have been with the company for 3 months, and lasts 6-9 months teaching you everything you need to know to become a Hotel Manager of the future.
 Travelodge pay starts at the National Living Wage, regardless of what minimum wage bracket you fall into, this makes the company ideal for school leavers looking for their first job as all required training is provided in house.

 The overbooking system works much like a bus or airline, where if a booking does not arrive, we are automatically overbooked by this amount the following year on that date.

However with the local pubs closing at 3, and the Taxis stopping at the same time, if we are unable to contact a guest until they arrive it can cause major issues in relocating a guest to our sister site.
 For housekeeping, while never working in the role myself, as a supervisor part of my job is to ensure that the time limits per room for the HKs are met, these times are far too short and put alot of strain on our teams.","First Job I actually Enjoy - Hotel Supervisor - Aaron I have worked for Travelodge for little under a year now and have enjoyed every step of the way.

At night I am left COMPLETELY ON MY OWN to do the following... (I might have forgotten a few things, as I am rushing to do this, but you will get the gist of what the job ACTUALLY entails)...
â€¢ Clean the kitchen down as the staff on the previous shift couldn't be bothered. They 'claim' that they were really busy, so therefore not had time BUT they clearly had time to have 18 cups of tea/coffee and 14 cig breaks!
â€¢ Empty all new linen cages onto shelves. Empty, wash and refill all tea & coffee caddies, wash and dry cups and cloths, fill the housekeeping buckets and bottles, fill housekeeping trolleys with all necessary items for the day ahead and prepare the housekeeping sheets, with instructions that they do not follow.
â€¢ Check people in on reception desk and create walk-in bookings.
â€¢ Help drunken people to there rooms and clean up their vomit.
â€¢ Help guests apply their WiFi code- most of the time it doesn't work, so I have to waste a good 30mins or so, on the phone going through WiFi troubleshooting.
â€¢ Complete Trackers for both F&B and linen.
â€¢ Process all invoices on the computer.
â€¢ Patrol the corridors every 15 mins and potentially put yourself in harm's way by evicting customers from their rooms, when smoke or are too noisy- There is NO CCTV in the corridor! Anything could happen to you and no one would know or care.
â€¢ Cook pizza, chips, panini etc... for hungry drunk guests all night.
â€¢ Complete regular fire walks.
â€¢ Serve drinks on the bar all night.
â€¢ Clean all public areas and toilets (including outside).
â€¢ Restock all bar fridges using stock rotation.
â€¢ Completing reception duties such as, running the 'End Of Day' completing recheck ins and printing out all reports needed for the day shifts to run smoothly, on the WORST operating system EVER!
â€¢ Set up restaurant for breakfast.
â€¢ Cook breakfast in the morning.
â€¢ Dealing with early departs and people constantly ringing the buzzer just to let me know that they are dropping the key back off, even though there is a sign stating to 'drop your key here'.
â€¢ Cleaning the entire kitchen to make it look that you haven't even been in there.
â€¢ Cashing up the bar till and reception.

Your job title is â€œTeam Member Receptionâ€ but you are expected to help clean rooms, cook food and be a security guard as well as do your own job. You do the job of 2-3 people for minimum wage. Youâ€™re inevitably going to make mistakes or leave guests unhappy and if you do and they put it on the post-stay survey then expect a telling off from management as the survey effects their bonus.

The company doesnâ€™t really care about the staff. Staff turnover is very high and then management canâ€™t be bothered to replace the people who leave. Management are far from professional. They can be very intimidating, demanding, manipulative and unreasonable.  

I have filed a grievance previously on advice from my Union Representative. I made the assumption that my concerns would be dealt with in a professional manner but they werenâ€™t. The manager that was part of the reason for my grievance knew the result before myself and then intimidated me for reporting the issues in the first instance. When reporting the grievance I called HR to ask what the policy was and how I should go about reporting this they told me that I should email them and theyâ€™d pass it to the relevant person. However, my manager accused me of not following procedure even though I had done what I was advised by HR.

You are sometimes expected to change your plans with a few days notice. So much for having a work life balance. The law says youâ€™re eligible for a break if you work over 6 hours (Not that you can take it if youâ€™re lone working) and a break of 11 hours between shifts. But that seems to go out of the window with Travelodge!

-I also attended a Supervisors workshop/training day in January in London and the train expenses event though I handed proof of the tickets to management the cost still wasn't covered!
More is expected from you than what is necessary - it can be great when it comes to helping your team when needed but there comes a time when if it comes down to you doing 2 departments work in 1 shift then it becomes a issue. - A lot of the time I find myself having to run reception and do housekeeping in 1 shift, there is no financial benefit to this side and next to no recognition for the extra work you're forced to do. - I say forced because if you leave any of your normal duties out  and  the next shift has to pick up on it management doesn't make any actions towards solving the issue.  - The hotel I work in the reception staff except the morning shift are all lone workers but large number of occasions when I've worked the morning shift without a housekeeper there is no support, so to clean rooms, public area's and keeping the reception manned for minimum wage - My hourly rate is only 30p higher than team members due to being a supervisor it isn't worth the extra workload and stress. 

Budgeted hours can be more of a problem than it needs to be. Due to hotel team sizes when it comes to covering holidays or absences it can become a unethical issue. 
My hotel team is a very small one and when management takes holiday or other staff I have found myself working 16hours in a single day and back to work the next day- this is also including back to back 16hour shifts - This is something I have done often and again there's been very little gratitude, when our rota's are submitted for our DM to approve this clearly isn't picked up by them or head office when the weekly hours get submitted to payroll. 
This has become a major issue for myself due to the negative effects this has on health which management seems so show little interest in. - The only time my manager showed an interest in was December past after a 16hour shift I drove home in heavy rain and ended in a crash due to tiredness which affected my driving, even after this I still found myself working these long shifts.

The only security you have when on your own is a safe guard that goes around your neck, if youâ€™re in any danger youâ€™re supposed to hold the button for 4-60 seconds and it would connect to an operator who would speak to you and decide if emergency service would need calling out. I find this to be terrible because it wouldnâ€™t actually stop you from being harmed. A floor walk is required every two hours through the night which can be very terrifying. A tragic incident recently happened at a travelodge but there were barely any changes made to the safety of the staff since.
As for housekeeping staff, thereâ€™s no set finish time itâ€™s always you finish when you finish which is mostly between 2pm-4pm but can be as late as 7pm. Managers sometime expect you to achieve the impossible.","Itâ€™s alright 50% discount on hotel rooms
