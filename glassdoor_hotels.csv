Do you think it's a good idea to put that box of soap there?"" 

They're also greedy, and underhanded, it takes everything people can do to keep them from stealing tips/gratuities. The seem to view tips/gratuities as a potential revenue stream. I recently heard they've tried to pay for security guards at events with the gratuity that gets tacked on to bills, which is meant for the staff.

Altogether I was there for six years. There was so much to love about this property: I loved my guests, my co-workers, and management was terrific. Lots of extra trainings (First Aid, CPR, etc.), team building, employee appreciation parties, etc. The GM is a real Rockstar, I loved him. My own boss, the Front Office Manager, was a remarkable woman, can't say enough great things about her. The location was great, parking sometimes challenging (not enough parking when things got busy, had to park blocks away.) Lots of interesting guests, lots of great events in house. I loved being the Concierge at the C.P., always so much going on downtown and fun to share this with my guests! I still think of it as ""my hotel"" whenever I drive by.","1) Pay is good for a young person who lives at home, but not for an adult paying off a mortgage. At the end of my six years, I earned $12.75 an hour. Raises were given in increments of .25 per year. 2) Concierge Team needs different uniforms from the Front Desk Agents. 3) Not enough FD Agents during our busy times and as a result, there was a big problem with retention of Front Desk Agents when I was there - the work could be intense during our busy seasons and the pay was inadequate for the intensity and abuse we received from angry guests. 4) When FD Agents quit, which was often, management had the Concierge Team work the FD and this got old very quickly (we're talking weeks and months.) 5) The Concierge position is being phased out, replaced by special information kiosks. This is great for some guests, but a real shame for others. Having a Concierge is so classy!"

If you're full-time, expect to work up to 8 days in a row, all shifts (except night audit unless you're trained), sometimes working until 11pm at night and then having to be there at 7am the next day. If you're part-time because you have a second job, for some reason, it's like pulling teeth to try and get them to work around your other job schedule.

Global HQ is a lovely place to come to work in with a gym and Starbucks coffee Shop and there is always something going on to communicate our latest brand initiative or when something new comes out. There is generally good collaboration across functions and lots of resources to set out measurements and what success looks like. The most professional company I have worked for with the best guest loyalty program and lots of focussed and well known brands.","We can forget we are a hospitality company. You have to be prepared to network and work across different functions, personalities and manage the self importance of some senior management. The company does not tolerate poor performance but it can take a year or two before you see action and this can be frustrating. Sometimes we don't live our 'Winning Ways' and we create a bubble in our corporate offices that everything is super when we are not always consistent at hotel level. The hotels don't get to see the impact of a new tool or initiative as we can be too busy creating the next big thing. Be prepared to be part of a matrix organisation where it is difficult to turn the ship around quickly and be responsive to our hotel owners and properties when linking in with non hotel facing colleagues."

The company does not focus on staff welfare, they are more interested in running their staff into the ground for below industry standard wages. There is a large focus on recruiting staff from Eastern Europe, whilst this would not normally bother me it is difficult to manage a team where they do not understand english very well.

When issues are brought up to senior managers, they are dismissed as the company has a 'we're correct, you're wrong' mentality. I am very experienced (possibly more experienced than some of the senior managers) in the hotel industry, having worked in 5 star resorts in the UK and I believe the way this company operates is ridiculous. If you have a look at the tripadvisor comments for most hotels in the company... this is reflected int he poor service that guests receive. 

The company focuses on profit way too much, the current budget cuts (to chase profit may I add) are running staff into the ground and causing them to resign. The company also have an excellent idea of promoting under skilled workers to managerial positions, simply because it is cheaper and they can save money on payroll. 

Unfortunately, this awful company has completely changed my opinion on the industry and I am glad to have left the company and the industry after having been ran into the ground. I'm always looking for ways to develop my career, hence my move to Macdonald Hotels. However, the position was sold to me based on a lie that the company puts its people at the forefront of everything they do."

Will constantly lie to you and sell you the dream. The reality is far from the dream! Two faced, back stabbing jobsworths are all around! The company promise is to grow a profitable hospitality business where it's guests leave happy and people stay happy. The guests may leave happy but that's only due to the fact that it's in our nature to provide a fantastic customer experience, that's why we are in the industry. It's nothing to do with the brand of hotel they chose where the staff don't have a uniform and are wearing their own clothes because we can't afford to buy uniforms this month. Well neither can the staff. It's supposed to be a perk of the job. So is staff meals on duty. If you consider a crusty dried up sandwich with no filling to speak of a staff meal then yes, that is a pro to the job. We don't have the equipment we need, we can't afford to buy any, repairs are cobbled together round the building as we can't even go out to B&Q to buy something for Â£0.75p to do a proper job. As a result the hotels look tired and in need of some investment and the staff look untidy. It's only their personalities that get the people coming through the door. No money for anything and yet it's nearly Â£5 for a cup of tea, salaried staff are on less than minimum wage after they've worked every shift going to save on payroll. All the stops are pulled out when there's a head office visit but get a great piece of business coming through the door and nobody bats an eyelid. Ethos is all wrong and they are impressing the wrong people. Staff aren't put on shift when they board come to stay so they can't see the shortfalls in the recruitment, selection and training processes so they probably have no idea how miserable the staff are, how non existent the training programme is, how poor they are at selecting the right people in the first place and how exploited everyone is.

Instead the company makes it's own prices up, not taking into consideration any of the clients you see every day.

This is now be counteracted by reviews which do not represent the company at all. 

There is no work life balance and I have never seen people be forced to take two days off. Staff generally work all the hours with no thanks.  Under staffed and under trained teams are common place within the hotels.

The training is completely no existent.  Staff retention is one of the worst I have ever come across. 

The company cannot even keep its People and Development Director which they have replaced twice in as many years due to company being that bad. If you can't keep the extremely talented people you bring in to fix the problems what hope is there??

Benefit system is no existent. You can only get staff rate rooms 14 days prior to arrival and then only if the hotel wants too. Often I've seen people not get staff rates as the hotels do not want to take lower rated rooms.  Other benefits do not exist. 

To have so many bad reviews and then all of a sudden having great 5 star reviews is not a true reflection of the company.

Higher management would not know who anyone is or care.  When higher management are on site it's panic stations and extra care given to everything.

They are kind during the application process and they give out programmes and induction guides when you start the new job.
Unfortunately these theoretical guides stay theoretical as well as anything else that can be written on paper (like SOPs).

I was often highly embarrassed that I was not able to deliver that kind of service guests do deserve due to missing equipment, due to being short staffed, due to cutting costs everywhere, due to ...

It was normal that a whole team was not able to go for a break during a whole shift.

Overtime is expected, but not paid. Sick days are deducted from the salary even when you could compensate them with your overtime.

Women on supervisory level have to wear skirts which make safe lifting not possible (but they make you do a course in safe lifting, again all theory).

I had to take insults regarding my age, my education, my gender and my nationality. Even the Managers from Headquarter and the GMs participated in this matter. There was no possibility to talk to HR as there is no longer HR in this company.

Communication culture is very bad and I was advised by a GM that I would have to â€žpush for thingsâ€œ in this company to get somewhere. Sad that polite and respectful manners were not appreciated.

Squeeze yourself with duties that are not related to you. Overload of work either because they are constantly cutting hours or ""saving cost"" to make more proffits. Not as a choice as mandatory. Not think that they are grateful for your big effort or you would have any compensation at all.Furthermore the more basic stuff are missing.That make you feel embarrassed facing with the customers.

Telling any higher position never intervened. So busy to do it. Or someone else in another moment will do it and obviously never happen. What a shame!! This is not the support that you need.

They prefer give anything for free if guest complain that improve or trust in yourself. You are never right. 

None from Head Office or related are been treated less than VVVIP any time that they visit at you. Doesn't matter for a lunch,stay...Good.
However the rest...have we even get provided food everyday? The answer it is no. Apparently we don't deserve it.
 
Benefits from the company are the uniform. And nothing else.
They say that meals is one of them. But it doesn't.
 Stay in any of the hotels for a special rate. But the occupancy of the place has to be less than 80% in case that this rarely happens you cannot book before 2 weeks because in case they will sold those rooms. What the point of plan your getaway always last minute and not sure if could be possible.
But it is so so complicated that they have very low occupancy. 
About the rest I work here few years and I don't get anything for that service time. Not when I made my first year,not in the second...
We used to have some nominations for employee of the month but they disappeared as well.

I do not recommend this place to work. Too many colleague have gone. People who worked very long years and made their best thousands times none has the time to wish them good luck. This is how they take care of employees.

Board members who instil fear into staff with their bullying and intimidating behaviour 

Out of date practices and expectations in 2017/2018

Discriminatory rules and staff worked into the ground and not given the breaks that they are LEGALLY entitled to because staffing is cut to the bone. Also under 18s made to work until 2am/3am. Paying staff less than minimum wage and passing it off as a minor inconvenience! 

Delusional senior management who actually think they are running a decent well respected hotel company - YOU ARE NOT! The company's reputation in the job market is shocking. That's why no-one of any repute lasts any time working for you - and why you struggle to fill key positions, despite paying a reasonable salary. 

Total focus on increasing prices beyond market expectation and constantly reducing costs - adding more pressure to the already overworked staff by constantly cutting back on staffing

Treating guests like a cash cow and misleading them  about the quality and source of their produce.

Hotels old fashioned and in need of refurbishment - a travelodge is a higher standard, yet they continually peddle them as 'luxury' (what a joke!).

Weak managers and regional managers who don't have the skills or the backbone to stand up to the bullying board members  - or who don't do it because they know they themselves will be dismissed if they challenge anything. 

Common practice for employees to be dismissed for petty reasons with no established legal processes followed. For example, the chairman takes a dislike to someone who serves him so the manager or head of department is told to get rid of that person. 

Staff are constantly worried about losing their jobs so don't stick around for any time at all. Continually recruiting for the same positions 

No HR in the company at all so no-one for staff members to speak to if they need to. Sums up this awful company's attitude to employee relations.

Pay rises for staff- It should be more easier to get a pay rise for the time you serve the company and if you deserve it. And this should be offered by the management and not by staff â€œ beggingâ€ for what they deserve.

Bonus program should be reviewed - I am not 100% if this is correct, however sometimes it seems that high managements donâ€™t worry in what they do to reach there goals so they donâ€™t loose the bonuses and sometimes the â€œlower staffâ€ is the ones that suffer with cuts. Again this is just what I think and sometimes looks what happens.

Staff wise, it's an absolute joke of a company, one which has earned itself a vile reputation in the Industry, a company that now ranks as the worst in the UK.

Staff are shown little respect, courtesy, empathy or even basic Human Rights. They are treated like skivvies, given monstrously long hours at times, but even have Hours cut back at very short notice, because ""budgets have to be met""!

If a potential employee, ask yourself these questions?
Do you wish to work for unknown hours each week?

Do you wish to work for a company which will take every penny of tips and keep it for themselves?
Do you wish to work in an environment where Bullying, Humiliation, Fear and Embarrassment are standard qualities by managers every single day?
Do you wish to occupy Live In accommodation which is so appallingly bad, that in the Private Sector, would see Landlords fined or imprisoned?
Do you wish to go hungry on a daily basis, because hotels have so little to spend on staff food? Well, I say ""food"" in its slightest term, as even the pigs at the local farms would turn their snouts up at it!!
Do you wish to work for a company who will reduce you to levels of Stress, even Mental Health issues, but refuse to accept or even consider these medical problems within the workplace?  Or when reported up the line of command, nothing gets done at all to stamp out the Bullies altogether!
Do you wish to work for a company, who will supply you with out dated working practices, out of date Equipment, working tools and so on, because they firmly believe that everything lasts forever?
Do you wish to work for a company who, when it all goes wrong, and guests complain, the staff will become the ""whipping boys"" and get the blame, whereas Head Office will hide away and regularly drop you in up to your neck?

I've experienced all of these issues in my time with this bunch of cowboys. I know of personnel diagnosed with Workplace Stress, Depression and other Mental Health issues whilst working for this bunch. Talk to Head Office about it? Not likely, they even refuse to accept these issues exist! I know of ex-personnel now going through Mental Health Therapy, caused in part to the daily Fear etc they'd undergo whilst at work in such a bad environment.

Only when hotel occupancy was around 40%. Overworked employees, very little care, management focused on cost cutting and not keeping employees happy, breaks often not giving despite 30 minutes taken out each shift, accounts withheld credit card gratituty and took several employee compliants over a 12 month period to get amended."

The autocratic hierarchical company set-up leads to fear trickling down, resulting in each level fearing those above them. Iâ€™ve heard numerous first hand accounts of team members receiving verbal abuse, even in support departments such as Sales. 

Recent changes in the way many hotels work have removed in-house Sales, HR, Accounts and other vital functions - resulting in a them/us culture with Head Office and people selling the hotels to clients who (through next fault of their own) have never visited the hotels and can therefore not sell productively. In what other industry would you have people selling a product which had not been sampled by the people selling it?! Budget restrictions account for a lot of the main problems, but there seems to be a lack of awareness that often investment leads to higher turnover and therefore profit. 

At my particular former property there are individuals in roles who are well known by senior managers to be wholly unsuitable...but a culture of â€˜someone is better than no-oneâ€™ prevails and these people stay and continually under perform. 

There are too many points for me to write here, but in summary - this company is rotten from the top down. Itâ€™s old fashioned approach will be its downfall. There are switched on, business minded people working in each property who are being stripped of any kind of responsibility and whoâ€™s ideas are continually ignored and belittled. There are passionate and talented employees who love what they do leaving because of the toxic environment they find themselves in. Such a shame as there is huge potential at property level which is overlooked to put all the hotel decisions and accountability with Head Office."

Not much else to say.,"Absolutely awful company to work for. They do not care about any their staff and give no training whatsoever. They expect certain people to do massive workloads on tiny salaries and let extremely overpaid employees (friends of the board) chill back and oversee. Everyone with any title has some relation to the board. Making redundancies in the most awful way. No potential to increase salary no matter how hard you work. No thanks for working as hard as you can. Asked to stay late or start early with no overtime paid out. Communication is absolutely horrible and any you do get appears to be bullying from previously mentioned board or friends of board.

No support given to heads of departments and with the removal of in house HR teams some years ago you are left to face everything from doing all the recruitment aspects, on boarding, training, dealing with employee issues along with trying to face the day to day tasks of running a busy business whilst all the time being told to cut payroll and costs meaning again extra hours are needed each week including working your days off just to fit everything in and to try and make sure the guest doesn't suffer. 
The pay is horrendous compared to other similar roles in similar properties and the false promises of a pay review three times in a row was the last straw for me and many other of my colleagues in the company within our region. 
I've been in the industry many years and this is by far the worst company to work for. Don't be fooled by the nice reviews on here, as they were put on at the numerous requests from the people development team at head office to staff they thought would leave a good review. 
The company has some great ideas such as the graduate scheme but again our graduate was dropped in at the deep end and lasted 3 months in the business due to the short staffing levels.  The pride training/buddy  scheme is a great idea but no one has the time to deliver it so it falls by the way side. The staff discount scheme is also good, but you try booking a staff rate room at a time you want to go such as school holiday and you can't and when you do get a room during the holidays at  a hotel you didn't really want to go to in the first place they cancel it on the day whilst you are travelling there, with no apology or booking made else where meaning you have to turn around and drive back home leaving the kids upset int he back of the car .........a great example of how much the company think of you as an employee."

After working in a Travelodge, I would never stay in one. Training was non existent. I had 2 shadow shifts before being placed on reception by myself during a friday evening. As a result the queue was out of the door as I attempted to do what I could. Company values were essentially ""pass on your issues to those below you"".","The tight budget that was allocated to the hotel wasn't even enough to cover costs for ample amounts of toilet paper and as a result, the manager was out of pocket due to filling in the gaps with their own money. The place was an embarrassment. I was there for a year and a half and had three different managers during that time. The second one refused to pay for things with his own money (fair enough) which left us without toilet roll for rooms. It's impossible to care for a job when you feel like the meat shield cast in front of the abuse that guest threw.  The aggressive tactic of overbooking was cruel both on staff and the guest.

District managers just look at quotas, but do nothing to support or provide missing/ broken essentials, repairs take long, and mostly we are just told to ""do without"". Staff is demotivated, as there is no bonus for them if they do well, and pay is minimal, even in London. Not many capable people can afford to work full 40h week and get Â£800 in London."

786801,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,12/07/2016, Hotel Manager,"Manchester, England, England",1,Ridiculous expectations,nothing that reasons being loyal to the company,Although the manager wage may be decent. by the time the week ends you would have done 50+ hours and the wage doesnt seem worth it anymore. The overbooking is ridiculously high and company itself doesnt know what policy to follow. Most of the changes are rushed and not explained properly. There is no protection got managers and NPS scores are used as a management punishment tool. However if you are a friend of a family then you can get away with anything. Its very common that friends and family work closely and it can be very biased and unfair.
786802,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,12/07/2016, Receptionist,"London, England, England",2,Steer clear from this Company!,"Some decent colleagues who work hard and are amicable.

Great friends and family rates. Thank you received after 6-9 months of employment which offers 50% off food and drink (except alcohol) in all branches.","Lack of management. Managers are incompetent in recognising people who work hard and are not able to enforce disciplinary action towards those really deserve it. There is considerable bullying and discrimination which takes place in the hotel. Company is great at turning a blind eye to these situations but it is very convenient.  There is little distinction in how management respond to those who pull their weight and those you make little or no effort. The first set of managers were exceptional but due to the shift in management the atmosphere changed drastically.  

Do not expect to receive adequate supervision at this franchise. There is a lot of roles you will need to take on with limited support. There is not much training provided and managers expect a high level of service being delivered even if there not invested in their own staff. Believe me when I say you are left to your own devices here!

For such a well known and successful franchise it is shocking that the company refuse to invest in a security office to guard the hotel. I did wonder numerous times about the safety of the customer and of course members of staff who are the heartbeat of this company.

NOTE: This franchise generates a high turnover in staff. I have witnessed a high number of people leaving the company due to being treated unfairly. You will get paid the minimum wage and be expected to lead a diverse role with limited support."

Managers were easy to talk to and communicate with.
Although it was not something I was ever interested in, advancing to a management position is relatively easy and Travelodge provide courses for the training.","Bare minimum staff and as a result staff are over-worked and stressed, if someone goes on holiday the entire place ceases to function correctly as there isn't enough staff available.
Overtime for everyone! Every day. Don't expect to go home on time.
You will be expected to work in the reception, bar, restaurant and also help cleaning the rooms, even if this is not your job title. 
Communicating with some staff can be difficult as English is not their first language, especially cleaners. It is very difficult if you are starting new as a cleaner to communicate with them.
No breaks and can't be seen drinking or eating on the job.
Very little training on how to use any of the systems, you will just be thrown in to deal with outdated checking in programs and tills which are very unfriendly."

Team members are developed into managers on a consistent basis providing they have the drive and skill set.

Developed further as a manager in terms of commercial skills, hr and h&s etc but this is because business operates on a minimal payroll model squeezing each person to the maximium.","Witnessed bullying, discrimination and harrasment several times by senior managers.  When reported it was dismissed despite several managers reporting similar.  

No stability in senior management team and often they are over promoted and out of their depths not knowing hospitality leading to poor leadership.

Poor pay at all levels apart from senior management.  On call 24/7 and expected to work over 48 hours a week or be managed for performance.

When CEO visits you are expected to not discuss any views or.opinions bar what you are told to by other senior managers.  For these visits you get loads of payroll and almost a whole refit.  I wonder if Mr Gowers actually sees the reality of working conditions."

You very rarely see the DM's. Management go on long training days/meetings which don't help staff at all. Morale in hotels are low. All management do is concentrate on targets and figures.

As a receptionist im expected to do cleaners jobs such as hoovering corridors, filling up soap dispensers and ironing shower curtains, bed runners and net curtains. Not why i applied for the job. Staff are very undervalued and unappreciated by anyone above management level. In a year im on my 3rd manager! So what does that tell u.

Sometimes.,"Other staff members won't always turn up to shifts so you end up working a double shift; make sure your out-of-work life is flexible because you'll have to cancel on a lot of people. 
The customers can be some of the rudest people; even if you are extremely polite and do as much as you can to help, they will not hold back on taking their unnecessary complaints out on you. 
Lone working at almost all times: I worked at a smaller Travelodge and the only time there were other members of staff to help me were the housekeeping staff during the morning shift. I think there should definitely always be at least two members of reception staff to help and support each other."

786858,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,24/10/2017, Receptionist,"Tiverton, South West England, England, England",5,Great company and good benefits,Travelodge are a great company to work for. They are flexible with shifts and offer you what you can manage. The discounts they offer you are great also and you can save quite a bit of money at times. Hours are manageable as well - good shift patterns,Minimum wage unfortunately and lone working most of the time
786859,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,25/10/2017, Housekeeper,"Bath, England, England",1,Housekeeper,Nice staff. Good banter with them. Average pay but could be better.,"As a healthy young individual it shocks me that I got painful muscle fatigue when working for Travelodge Bath Waterside. We are expected to carry a cleaning caddy full with full bottles of soap (which gives your skin dermitis) in one hand, juggling a hoover, a mop and rubbish bag to each room sometimes up and down floors. Supervisors donâ€™t chuck away rejects out of pure laziness and take so long to replenish our trolleys when we run out of toilet roll, or plastic cups or towels."
786860,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,26/10/2017, Housekeeping Supervisor,"Kings Cross, England, England",1,Worst Place I've Ever Worked,"I honestly can't think of any. Oh, there's free tea in the cafe if you want it. That's about it.","Well where do I start...one thing is nobody speaks English. I was told as a new housekeeping supervisor that I 'better learn body language because nobody here's speaking English' by my manager. I was also told that I was a 'tramp' by the same manager, for wearing the uniform she insisted that I wore (because they refused to get a shirt in my size. I am a size 20-22 so it's not that hard) which was actually a mans shirt two sizes too big. 

Another con is you sign a contract for a 30 hour work week but they wring 40 hours out of you. They will make you work eight hour days and give you a 20 minute lunch break, which is against the law. They also dictate to you where you eat lunch and won't allow you to leave the premises, like a prisoner. They speak to you like dirt, and the staff are all hostile, rude, angry individuals, with no social skills. They don't follow what you tell them to do as a supervisor, in fact they use the pillow cases that they put on peoples beds to clean the bathrooms and the dirty toilet out with. It's standard practice there and the chambermaids feel it's quicker than using sponges. So no, I'd never sleep on a travelodge pillow if you paid me. It's dirty, the hotel isn't invested in and its full of moths.

But the main issue were the staff. I had one worker tell me she 'felt sorry for me' when I asked why, she replied 'because you're white and british'. This is how they speak to their new trainee managers. It's an atrocious company to work for, I'd never work there again.  If you're an English person or just a white one who isn't Eastern European don't work there as you will be bullied and alienated. The level of racism among the staff is also astounding.  The staff are in fact the worst thing about the entire hotel. Just go somewhere else, whoever you are you deserve better."
786861,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,31/10/2017, Reception Team Member,"Manchester, England, England",1,"Awful, wouldn't even give it 1 star.","Staff discount at other Travelodge hotels. Only writing more to reach the 20 word minimum, zero other pros of working here","- Lone working meaning you don't even get a proper uninterrupted break (pretty sure that is illegal!)

- Management think they are someone, and treat you like you are worthless. My contract was 16 hours yet some weeks I was on 5 x 8 hour shifts. Extremely patronising towards me. Walking in whilst I was on shift and just stating what wasn't right - maybe try some positives before telling the poor minimum wage receptionist what hasn't been done. Maybe something had happened whilst you were sat in bed meaning they couldn't clean the reception area!

- Rota getting changed without notification. Usually the managers friends refusing to do the shifts they have been put on. Managers NEVER worked two weekends running - if they had done one Saturday morning shift in a month they seemed to think they had done their fair share. 

- Manager never put enough cleaners on shift meaning I would regularly be told, not even asked, that I would be cleaning as well as doing reception. I didn't apply to clean so I should never have been expected to do it. Absolutely vile. 

- The staff moral is horrendous. Nobody wants to be there, luckily for me it was only ever a job to get some money whilst I waited for my current job. 

- Called into the office for two documented meetings. Not once was I notified that they would be happening, just one day two managers walk in with a face like thunder telling me to go into the office. Quite sure this is also not allowed, I should have been allowed to take a representative in with me, and I didn't even know what I had done wrong."

Things are reported and then left for weeks sometimes months with nothing done. The place is dangerous and open to a lawsuit at any minute. They do not comply with health and safety laws in the work place. 

Nastyy staff that call one another off like a bunch of primary school kids. 

Staff welfare is not cared about at all. Expected to do the job of cleaner, rectoionist and general dogs body when employed as a rectoinisy, oh yes and security guard! No cctv, lone working, frequent issues with aggressive guests at weekends, had the police here three times in less than a year and that's just my part time shift! Even the police said they couldn't believe how badly staff safety is! I split up a fight between two males while calling police and since it happened my manager has not once asked me if I'm ok or what went on. 

Example of frequent complaints, dirty underwear left in supposedly clean room that someone checked into! Do not stay at travel lodge it's filthy! 

Constant over booking of rooms means you are left to face angry guests whom threaten and scream at times! And who can blame them! This doesn't bode well for your safety though. 

You do anything wrong and they are on your case like mad yet they don't care about staff welfare at all! Certain people also do not get challenged about issues while others do! The place is dreadful and management haven't got a clue what they are doing from what I have seen. I have always had career jobs so this is just a passing stop gap THANK GOD! For anyone who is looking for long term employment apply for the premier inn, they are cleaner by miles, addere to health and safety and don't treat you like a dogs body!

There's so little progression. If you're lucky, you'll make it onto a management scheme. But anyone who's studying a University degree - or who has studied one for any length of time - is unable to enroll. Meh.
It's monotonous. I do the cooking all the damn time. And then clean. Because no one can do. Why?
Because another con - it's understaffed. Massively. Three people to cover a bar, reception and kitchen. Imagine if it suddenly gets busy? You're suddenly far too overworked, as a cook.
It's only Â£7.50. For some of the stuff we put up with, we aren't paid enough to deal with it. Definitely have a look at Lidl who offer nearly Â£12 per hour."

Management friendly 
Original interview was quick and to the point and I was phoned about 40 minutes after applying online to come in for the interview.","Minimum wage, although about Â£1 extra for nights. For the amount of abuse you take on reception it's not enough, normal security measures are using 'Skygaurd' a radio like device, who in most situations tell you to ring the police yourself..
Can be working alone in a 100+ room hotel for an entire shift (god forbid the Fire Alarm ever goes off) which is fine in small lodges but when your lone working and have to run up 8+ floors to source the fire and look after guests it's a joke. 
Also meant to have extra staff when disabled people are occupying rooms, this does not happen, have been left alone  with 5 accessible rooms occupied with those who need help. 

It's a 'who you know' work place with management seemingly playing favourites. 
Managers/district managers and Head Office not caring about hotel maintenance or security measures for staff, such as no heating in lobby with the doors broken as as such can't lock them at night, no matter how many times your report the job. 

Discount doesn't include alcohol and friends and family rooms are barely available anymore. 

Check the hours available on interview and make it clear what you need , as it was advertised as 40+ hours a week only for 1 month in the manager to turn round and say it's only because of other people's holiday and attempt to only schedule the contracted 16 hours a week, which affects people's lives when they are expecting a full time job."

The hours and shifts are flexible, the benefits are amazing - discounts on hotels of course and also retail discounts for loads of places.

There are many opportunities to learn and progress with in the company and I think this is great for those who know what they want to achieve within their career path.  Each and every shift is different from the last and you meet so many different people and you get the chance to be part of their experience staying at your hotel whether it is for business, personal or even small break away from home.

I have worked here for just over a year and started as a receptionist. I had no experience but a general idea of the job. Within the short time I have been here I have progressed to be hotel supervisor, and I have just started the in house Aspire Traveller course which trains you to become Assistant hotel manager or Hotel manager in smaller hotels witihin travelodge. The company will help you progress further on your career path as long as you put the effort it.","As a Hotel Supervisor you are given extra responsibilities with a very small pay increase. When the manager is off your are expected to take over running the hotel but without any of the benefits of being assistant manager e.g Salary, Keyholder bonus etc. Taking anytime off is usually an impossibility due to so low staff levels. We currently have just enough staff to cover each shift which means when someone is ill or on holiday we all have to do a lot of extra  hours e.g double shifts to cover."

From first week I was informed of the Aspire management program and I'm very pleased to say that I have now been accepted on to the course.  
Company that cares - I work in a fairly small hotel with great close-knit team and we all work really well together. We have a great line of communication with our manager who we know is always available and happy to help! Other hotel managers and team members are also only a phone call away, so even when working alone you know there is someone always there. Travelodge also cares what each individual thinks, you can pass on any concerns/suggestions/queries whatever it mayb, to your manager who will either work closely with you at hotel level or pass it on to relevant people. I feel like my opinion matters and things I say are taken on board.
Flexible working hours - I started working at Travelodge with a temporary reception 8 hr contract, I am now on a full time Supervisor 32 hr contract, this is a great company to be part of if you need to work around other obligations.  With the option to work a variety of shift times, I am able to fit my work around busy life and know that if I have issues with the rota I can talk to another team member about swapping shifts or have a quick chat with our manager to see if things can be rearranged.  
Benefits - Not only do we get fantastic room rates for all of Travelodges 500+ hotels but as an employee we are able to receive great deals and discounts across lots of high street brands: Supermarkets, phone companies, electrics and restaurants just to name a few!","Travelodge will become one of your main topics of conversation, (everyday is different and you meet some really interesting characters!) this may irritate friends and family, but they will get their own back by pestering you for friends and family room rates!"

If there are no witnesses nothing will be done! I had keys thrown at me and personal belongings broken by other staff amongst other things and nothing was done! 
There is no cctv anywhere in hotel or grounds
Lone worker
Expected to do alsorts from lugging laundry up stairs to cleaning up after cleaners that can't be assed to clean up after themselves. 
Dealing with guests fighting, ejecting guests from hotel without support or back up! 
Travel lodge are obsessed with saving money and this is at the expensive or guests and the safety of staff.
Lights in corridors were changed to come on when movement sensed this meant guests were half way up stairs in pitch black before they came on and I spent half the night in the dark up and down corridors!
Health and safety doesn't exist! Cleaners throw lost property around and on two occasions I nearly had my hand off on knives that has been found in rooms and just thrown on reception desk under papers instead of dealt with! 
Anything that breaks in travel lodge stays broken for months at a time! I ended up in a and e as a result of a draw that someone has removed runners on and not said anything so I pulled it open and it flew out and landed on my foot! I couldn't walk properly for three days. This was left broke for weeks and weeks after until eventually a work man came but as I pointed out if it injured me again I would take legal action! 
The dirty Landry is in the same room as the clean and the room is very small and cramped something I'm sure guests wouldn't like, I wouldn't want to sleep on sheets that had touched someone else's dirty ones! 
There was also a fridge in the room where the dirty Landry is kept which I'm sure isn't ok under environmental health laws. 
All in all the place has no health and safety and allows bullying to go on! If you want to work here do so at your own peral. 
If you have a problem with your pay don't expect to talk to payroll as they only communicate with managers!"
786941,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,06/05/2018, Team Member,"Paya Lebar, ",2,Pay more to retain good staff,"Discounts on hotels, people, food",Minimum wage means high staff turnover
786942,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,10/05/2018, Cleaner,"London, England, England",4,it was a good interview that made me a permamnent staff,it allows for connection of knowing more colleages,it does nt allow for exchanging of company information
786943,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,10/05/2018, Front Desk Receptionist,"Oxford, England, England",3,Full time receptionist,Lots of people leaving regularly which meant extra hours available if you want them. On the night shift not much is going on after you have finished your work so you can watch a movie on the side in reception. Managers are not normally around after 6pm so the evening shift is better then the morning and they are never there on the night shifts which can be an added bonus (especially if they are bullies).,"Being asked to cover shifts at the last minute especially by staff that are suddenly leaving, whilst I was there a staff member left every month from a team of receptionists that where only 4 on days and 2 on nights, the entire team refreshed after 6 months. Some hard working and long standing staff members left after they had difficulty getting on to the Aspire course which is Travelodges (training course) and one of only ways to move up the ladder with them. Places are limited and from what I heard whilst being there most people don't get on. I was there for almost a year. 

Wage is minimum and even on promotion it is only Â£1 more. Managers are paid commission so push staff hard to get their key drivers, some of them are lazy so get ready to cover part of there work. 

If you want to get on the course your manager has to put you forward positively so you will have to cover all the extra shifts and awkward shifts to get on the course, quickest you can get on is after about 8 months so be ready for hard work. If a staff member leaves which is inevitable then get ready to work 50/60 hour weeks at awkward times. Another guy that worked there actually said to me he has no life outside of work as he was studying at the same time. Same as me at the time, I was doing a 50 hour week then. 

Your weekends are not yours, they belong to the company and if your manager changes the times and shifts at the last minute then you have no choice but to except even if you have children, this is not the most parent friendly company.  Some managers won't hire until you say you are available for all shifts.  If your a student say which days you can't work in the interview otherwise they won't let you have them off. 

Some managers are not that experienced, few have degrees themselves, this was the case for me. Managers may act aggressively and can start to shout badly, if they do this then don't leave the company, first complain and then leave if that's what you intend on doing, this is because complaints are not taken seriously if you leave and then complain. If they start to shout and bully you complain on the same day, don't wait, unfortunately this happens and is not taken seriously enough. 

Housekeeping/cleaners have the hardest job as they are paid for each room they clean and told they have to do it in 20 mins. Most cannot keep to the times, on busy days they are given more rooms then aloud. It is supposed to be 10 rooms full clean maximum but they often go to 13 with another 2 as service cleans (half cleans). I don't advise you work here as a housekeeper, join another brand. 

Sometimes staff do not have time to clean time fully due to a lack of staff. Travelodge are incredibly penny pinching, they don't take agency staff at all, hence the erratic shifts when someone takes time off. If you have to work Thursday through to Sunday then get ready for a hectic set of shifts, you are unlikely to have enough housekeepers on, and will have too many rooms to clean from my experience."

786951,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,21/06/2018, Assistant Hotel Manager,"Covent Garden, England, England",1,Assistant Manager Review,"â€¢	50% discount of food and room.  (The problem is working here will put you off 
       sleeping or eating in any Travelodge hotel in the country)

â€¢	Some of the team members are hard working and fun to work with.

â€¢	Some of the guests can be really nice friendly people to deal with.","Very low pay compared to other hotels in Central London.  Salary differs quite drastically among the team of AHMâ€™s. 

I was not paid for the first two months of my employment and I had to constantly chase this with HR, and Senior Management who paid little interest or care in the matter.

Huge lack of training for external managers.  Some training will take place but it is no preparation for the job.  You will train on the job, mostly learning from the team members you have to manage.  Once completing â€˜trainingâ€™ you are expected to manage and motivate a team of people who do very demanding and physically tiring, un-rewarding work on very long hours for minimum wage.  

You will be forced to work long unsociable hours without taking breaks and covering shifts for Team Members who donâ€™t turn up.  You will be regularly forced to stay hours past your finish time and work days on end without a day off.  Your body clock will be completely out of sync and it will have a serious effect on your physical and mental health.  Travelodge find it acceptable for you to finish a shift at 11pm and start again the next day at 7am.  If you complain you are told that as a manager you need to be flexible to meet the needs of the business.

Travelodge have a policy of over booking which results in guests arriving late being sent to other hotels.  You are told this doesnâ€™t happen often.  It happens regularly.  This is difficult, not only for the staff but also for the customers.

Head Office are slow to respond when you need them and donâ€™t fully understand the complexities of running a large hotel in Central London.  Mice, bed bugs and flies were regular problems you have to deal with.  Mice running through the dining area is a regular problem as well as mice in rooms and flies on food.  If people complain you offer them a voucher and call pest control who do a temporary fix until next time.  At Covent Garden you deal with drunk people, drug abusers, homeless people, a constant flow of human traffic, its all part of your minimum wage responsibilities.

The only time official policies are followed correctly is when there is a visitor from Head Office or Member of Senior Management in the building.  You then put on your fake smiles and roll out the â€˜goodâ€™ team members and pretend everything is running perfectly.  Health and Safety is atrocious.  Staff are asked to falsify documents by signing check sheets that were never completed in the first place which are then checked by auditors.

There is no structure or accountability for the team of managers.  As a manager once you have trained someone up to do the job well they can become very quickly demotivated and leave as they know they are worth more than a minimum wage job.  Understandably this results in incredibly high staff turnover.  Not just for team members, but managers too.  There was a rotating door of managers coming and going during the 16 months I was there.  During an interview process one of the managers told me we already have enough black people on the team and we should think about that during the interview process.  Needless to say,  HR practices are shocking.  A lot of the staff donâ€™t speak enough English.  They donâ€™t know their rights and do not how to / are too scared to stand up for themselves so are used like slaves working long hours for minimum wage.  Travelodge have a standard way of cleaning rooms via the ten steps.  This doesnâ€™t work in big hotels due to lack of staff and demands to get rooms cleaned as quickly as possible.

Travelodge have created a toxic environment in their flagship hotel and have proven they have no care for the most important part of the hotel â€“ the people!  The main focus of the hotel is Key Drivers and figures, WYR scores and TripAdvisor reviews.  Staff turnover is of no concern to management.  Racial discrimination and bullying tactics are an intrinsic part of Travelodge culture and are accepted as the norm by Senior Management, as long as their targets and bonuses are safe, they are happy.  If you have a conscious, a soul or a shred of humanity, it might be worth applying elsewhere."

Sometimes I was the only employee in the whole hotel. 
No breaks, sometimes I would be standing without a break for over 8 hours.

Hotel was notorious for overbooking, had angry customers on a daily basis. 
I wasnt allowed to be behind reception, I was to stand in front of the desk with the computer rotated around, many customers questioned this, why??

Both employees and managers are so supportive to whatever step you take in life, whether that be at work or in your social life, so if staff decide to further their knowledge and want to progress in the Travelodge company, many steps are suggested  and encouraged e.g. taking a supervisor role. I have worked as a receptionist at Travelodge for 10 months now and it has allowed me to further my knowledge about not only the company but the different career paths that are available for me and other staff. At Travelodge they offer a course called ASPIRE to develop further, with help and one to ones from Hotel Managers and Assistant Managers, monthly workshops and challenges set inside the staff gain essential skills and knowledge to be able to,one day, run and manage a Travelodge hotel. The course is open to every staff member from any department of the hotel who is willing to put the effort and time into.

At Travelodge there are many benefits and perks which every employee is open to, which is so amazing because it shows that as a company, Travelodge care about every single staff member by rewarding them. Each employee is entitled to to discounts on room rates for any of the 500+ Travelodge Hotels there are in the country,  with up to 50% off for staff for rooms and food and beverages in any bar cafe and there are discounts for friends and family as well.","Don't have any cons, there are ups and downs to every job"

Working for Travelodge, you have the oportunity to get involved with all aspects of running a hotel so the job is varied and interesting.  The management are caring and supportive and try to give a fair and equal work life balance to all staff which must be challenging as reception is covered 24 hours, 7 days a week.  During my time here, I have been learning certain managerial role duties and have been developing my career path since I joined.  I have just been given the opportunity to further develop my role as a hotel manager by joining on the Aspire - Traveller programme and can't wait to develop my knowledge and skills further.  Travelodge offer fantastic career opportunities to their staff if they wish to progress.  It's a great place to work, friendly environment, work colleagues are caring, supportive and fun to work alongside.  Lastly, our guests are fantastic.","As it's 24 hour reception, 7 days a week, you must be prepared to work shifts and work weekends although managers do try to make the staff rotas fair."

Our Hotel may be small and beautiful but the personalities of the staff make this place a joy to be.
On a personal level I was just looking for a change of career and something basic that suited  and gave a decent home life / work life balance, As I previously owned my own Day nursery and as fantastic as it was an for all the money i earnt ...the home life balance wasn't there .

little did i know what a breath of fresh air it was to be employed by Travelodge on the parent friendly hours that fitted in with the school runs and the responsibilities of being a parent !.wow ....I got to be a Good mum again .school was covered ..dinners made and i still feel proud that am working despite the jobrole because all cogs make the clock tick.

In Travelodge  the support is there if you wish to push yourself ...try something new or really get stuck in ...

so recently I have been accepted on The Aspire Traveller Programme and again It seems to have its own balance,that too doesn't effect home /existing work life balance but gives you a gentle route into  New successes and achieving through set challenges and   workshops.


Being a Driven person i cant believe that I have stumbled across the Perfect job that has give me a new level of confidence.

As they saying goes you really do get back what you put in with Travelodge ...and Aspire has inspired me to Aim high",only con for me Personally is I like to learn fast and programme is spaced over a few months (but again its that perfect balance which so am looking forward to the journey and taking it all in with out rushing )

 The benefits for team members including discount rooms and high street shopping, mamagement advancement courses and pension schemes are great.
 The Aspire Traveller Course, one of the advancement courses I am about to begin is open to all who have been with the company for 3 months, and lasts 6-9 months teaching you everything you need to know to become a Hotel Manager of the future.
 Travelodge pay starts at the National Living Wage, regardless of what minimum wage bracket you fall into, this makes the company ideal for school leavers looking for their first job as all required training is provided in house. 
 Now is an ideal time to join our team, with a new hotel opening on average every 18 Days, the demand for staff to fill new jobs has never been higher! The Company C.E.O, A Mr.P. Gowers, while I have never met him myself, seems to be a fantastic people person and the ideal C.E.O to guide Travelodge to greater heights.","I only have 2 points of concern, the Overbooking system, and Housekeeping Time Restraints.
 The overbooking system works much like a bus or airline, where if a booking does not arrive, we are automatically overbooked by this amount the following year on that date. For a smaller and busier hotel such as the one where I am based this can cause sever problems as we are a short Taxi ride from one of the UKs busiest wedding venues. However with the local pubs closing at 3, and the Taxis stopping at the same time, if we are unable to contact a guest until they arrive it can cause major issues in relocating a guest to our sister site.
 For housekeeping, while never working in the role myself, as a supervisor part of my job is to ensure that the time limits per room for the HKs are met, these times are far too short and put alot of strain on our teams."

- it allows one to develop their communication skills by interacting with customers.
- it enables one to gain in insight into the hotel industry.
- there is a lot of work flexibility, which enables one to select their shifts according to convenience.","- although the staff provide a good service for customers, the limitations of the hotel itself means that it is not possible to provide the best service possible at all times.
- it is very difficult to resolve a customers problems instantly because contact with the HBST needs to be made via email, thus meaning that the customers may not be satisfied.
- to gain extra revenue, the hotel has overbooked customers.  Therefore, staff have been forced to send customers to other hotels, meaning that the customers are unlikely to return to the hotel again."

One of the excellent things about Travelodge as well as other good benefits such as a company pension, 50% off Travelodge rooms, Friends and family discount, various retail discounts, discounts on beds and mattresses and an excellent training and development programme. The Management structure beyond the Hotel is excellent in the way its structured and is easily accessible.  I feel like a part of a very big family.  I like how each hotel has a â€˜Buddy siteâ€™ you can go to for help if needed.  The Google+ site is amazing for all hotels nationally to connect.

Whilst at Travelodge i have dealt with many people and and many situations that have caused me to adapt myself and my environment in order to give the best customer experience possible.
Travelodge has also taught me that i can continue to grow and that all experiences, although not necessarily comfortable at the time help me to continue my personal development. Among a few of the skills i have further developed whilst with Travelodge include multi-tasking, being able to work as a team as well as independently, attention to detail, time management, taking initiative, communication, flexibility and staying calm under pressure.

Given support in role while training from management and staff, as well as having further support from Travelodge HQ if needed.  

Management within the hotel frequently help on all aspects of the hotel chores from housekeeping to cooking, a refreshing change from management.   While maintaining a professional level management are connected and interactive with team, listening to staff and where possible implementing staff ideas.  A day in hospitality is highly unpredictable, as such when management are not on duty there is little/no criticism of actions/decisions made by staff to carry out duties.  

Opportunities for advancement within the Travelodge brand.  Through role you learn many aspects of the hotels running.  In the customer service positions the roles are flexible where you cover many different sections, this brings variety and change in chores to role.   Travelodge seek positive, committed and reliable staff with experience not being a prerequisite unlike other employers.

An amazing team to work alongside minus management.","Management is atrocious. The way management treat their staff is a disgrace. Management all have their favourites, and if you arenâ€™t one of their â€˜possyâ€™ then you may as well just accept that your life will be hell in your job. Donâ€™t speak to management about any issues you have because either the whole team will find out about them, or nothing will get done about them (especially if the issue is regarding one of the managers friends, then you have no chance!). No repercussions for some peopleâ€™s actions but as soon as someone that doesnâ€™t suck up to the manager steps out of line, people need retrained, and there needs to be coaching and advice/fact finding.  The district manager, even if youâ€™re not hitting any targets, doesnâ€™t care and only relays this to management, thereâ€™s no verbal communication with staff when visiting sites which makes staff feel unappreciated for how much they do. Management are completely unapproachable. If you go to your manager with something regarding her/him, expect your life to turn into a living hell."

My advice to anyone applying for this job - you could be the best and hardest worker and they will still expect more! I stayed behind 3 hours more than my usual finish time to help them do 20 more rooms and I did not even receive a thanks! Itâ€™s expected of you to also have to work harder if someone is ill or not in (I donâ€™t see how this should affect other housekeeping staff but they do put it on you).

99% of the time my hotel is completely full.
During the day there are 3 or more staff on duty...
At night I am left COMPLETELY ON MY OWN to do the following... (I might have forgotten a few things, as I am rushing to do this, but you will get the gist of what the job ACTUALLY entails)...
â€¢ Clean the kitchen down as the staff on the previous shift couldn't be bothered. They 'claim' that they were really busy, so therefore not had time BUT they clearly had time to have 18 cups of tea/coffee and 14 cig breaks!
â€¢ Empty all new linen cages onto shelves. Empty, wash and refill all tea & coffee caddies, wash and dry cups and cloths, fill the housekeeping buckets and bottles, fill housekeeping trolleys with all necessary items for the day ahead and prepare the housekeeping sheets, with instructions that they do not follow.
â€¢ Check people in on reception desk and create walk-in bookings.
â€¢ Help drunken people to there rooms and clean up their vomit.
â€¢ Help guests apply their WiFi code- most of the time it doesn't work, so I have to waste a good 30mins or so, on the phone going through WiFi troubleshooting.
â€¢ Complete Trackers for both F&B and linen.
â€¢ Process all invoices on the computer.
â€¢ Patrol the corridors every 15 mins and potentially put yourself in harm's way by evicting customers from their rooms, when smoke or are too noisy- There is NO CCTV in the corridor! Anything could happen to you and no one would know or care.
â€¢ Cook pizza, chips, panini etc... for hungry drunk guests all night.
â€¢ Complete regular fire walks.
â€¢ Serve drinks on the bar all night.
â€¢ Clean all public areas and toilets (including outside).
â€¢ Restock all bar fridges using stock rotation.
â€¢ Completing reception duties such as, running the 'End Of Day' completing recheck ins and printing out all reports needed for the day shifts to run smoothly, on the WORST operating system EVER!
â€¢ Set up restaurant for breakfast.
â€¢ Cook breakfast in the morning.
â€¢ Dealing with early departs and people constantly ringing the buzzer just to let me know that they are dropping the key back off, even though there is a sign stating to 'drop your key here'.
â€¢ Cleaning the entire kitchen to make it look that you haven't even been in there.
â€¢ Cashing up the bar till and reception.

I am able to drop my children off to school and be there to greet them at the end of their school day. Make all I need to with any special school events with given notice, The management are so very accommodating to all of that, and if there are any changes? They will do their very best to make sure you dont miss out on those important moments with your family. 
I get to work one weekend on and one off which is good going, two weekends a month spending much needed family time.","The only thing that I find difficult is that it is in a rota system, although the company/management are extremely accommodating to changes, you can't pre plan much, as you are waiting on what days you are on next, with given a three week rota in advance, but changes can be made with only giving 24 hours notice. It would be nice to be knowing on set days of working, giving parents a routine rota. Your hours are estimated, and generally the same finish time each week because of the times you need to leave for your children, but weekends tend to be later in finishing, with a later start which is difficult as weekends, because the need for family time when both parents work through the week, so at weekends would be nice to have the same times as weekdays working times. Give you that earlier finish. And you have time to do things with your family, and home."

The company also does not hire cleaners or extra staff for night shifts, so if there are any problems it is usually down to two team members to handle the whole hotel during the night, which includes cleaning the bar/cafe and kitchen while checking in guests. Very stressful working environment where staff are not supported by management, and instead staff were yelled at. Supervisors do not actually supervise, and instead guests have witnessed them hitting the printers in the reception and throwing things when they get angry. Better training and recruitment is needed for everyone. Senior managers promoted staff that they were friends with rather than competent people."

Â£50 evoucher for anniversary,"The pay is low for what you have to do. Your job title is â€œTeam Member Receptionâ€ but you are expected to help clean rooms, cook food and be a security guard as well as do your own job. You do the job of 2-3 people for minimum wage. Youâ€™re inevitably going to make mistakes or leave guests unhappy and if you do and they put it on the post-stay survey then expect a telling off from management as the survey effects their bonus.

The company doesnâ€™t really care about the staff. Staff turnover is very high and then management canâ€™t be bothered to replace the people who leave. Management are far from professional. They can be very intimidating, demanding, manipulative and unreasonable.  

I have filed a grievance previously on advice from my Union Representative. I made the assumption that my concerns would be dealt with in a professional manner but they werenâ€™t. The manager that was part of the reason for my grievance knew the result before myself and then intimidated me for reporting the issues in the first instance. When reporting the grievance I called HR to ask what the policy was and how I should go about reporting this they told me that I should email them and theyâ€™d pass it to the relevant person. However, my manager accused me of not following procedure even though I had done what I was advised by HR.

You are sometimes expected to change your plans with a few days notice. So much for having a work life balance. The law says youâ€™re eligible for a break if you work over 6 hours (Not that you can take it if youâ€™re lone working) and a break of 11 hours between shifts. But that seems to go out of the window with Travelodge! 

Staff at head office are very out of touch with us the people who actually need to deal with the customers.  They find ways to cut costs and change procedures to â€œhelp usâ€ but it just makes our job harder."

787205,Travelodge-Hotels-UK,28/04/2020, Hotel Supervisor,"Barton Stacey, England, England",3,Average Hotel Company,"Company is more than likely to hire those with next to no work experience so it's a good way to get into the Hospitality business. 
Company pays all age groups same hourly rate, - Kitchen staff, Reception (except night workers) and Housekeeping are all on the same hourly rate. 
There is a opportunity for career progression through the Aspire course although if you have worked for the company for some time -personally I started as a Housekeeper and made my way up to Reception and eventually to Hotel Supervisor and there is very little this course can offer you that you more than likely won't already know. 
Although the company works on a tight budget more than likely you get offered more hours than your contracted - especially when staff and management take holiday.","Travel expenses aren't covered! - I had to pay Â£200 out of my own pocket to attend work this year due to my car being in the garage, I had 1 trip to work covered which was Â£100 but then was informed if I needed to book taxi again the expenses won't be repaid but I'm still expected to attend my shift-to clarify the taxi trips cost more than what I earned during the shifts so financially it wasn't worth attending work and management team was away at a event during this period so I had to pay extra Â£200 due to lack of staffs availability.
-I also attended a Supervisors workshop/training day in January in London and the train expenses event though I handed proof of the tickets to management the cost still wasn't covered!
More is expected from you than what is necessary - it can be great when it comes to helping your team when needed but there comes a time when if it comes down to you doing 2 departments work in 1 shift then it becomes a issue. - A lot of the time I find myself having to run reception and do housekeeping in 1 shift, there is no financial benefit to this side and next to no recognition for the extra work you're forced to do. - I say forced because if you leave any of your normal duties out  and  the next shift has to pick up on it management doesn't make any actions towards solving the issue.  - The hotel I work in the reception staff except the morning shift are all lone workers but large number of occasions when I've worked the morning shift without a housekeeper there is no support, so to clean rooms, public area's and keeping the reception manned for minimum wage - My hourly rate is only 30p higher than team members due to being a supervisor it isn't worth the extra workload and stress. 

Budgeted hours can be more of a problem than it needs to be. Due to hotel team sizes when it comes to covering holidays or absences it can become a unethical issue. 
My hotel team is a very small one and when management takes holiday or other staff I have found myself working 16hours in a single day and back to work the next day- this is also including back to back 16hour shifts - This is something I have done often and again there's been very little gratitude, when our rota's are submitted for our DM to approve this clearly isn't picked up by them or head office when the weekly hours get submitted to payroll. 
This has become a major issue for myself due to the negative effects this has on health which management seems so show little interest in. - The only time my manager showed an interest in was December past after a 16hour shift I drove home in heavy rain and ended in a crash due to tiredness which affected my driving, even after this I still found myself working these long shifts. 

Hotel budgets for hours and spending needs better reviewed. 
Spending budgets for hotels  are very poor, even smaller hotels they need a better budget if they are to keep up with the standards that the company expects them to be."

Sales and Marketing strategy tends to dismiss female bias and lacks leadership believing strategy is threatened. Former leadership was supportive of sales and marketing strategy.

PR, Press and external Comms is a bullying strategy and has never been addressed... the turnover in PR, Press and Comms is a joke and former leadership has turned a blind eye because PR, Press and external Comms   has the ""right"" connections in media strategy. Concerning but true.

You are expected to do room checks even though it is the morning reception shift's job and they're either sometimes not done or not done properly so you have no choice. It's either that or get bad reviews and then you get the blame and not the colleague who should have checked the rooms correctly in the first place when the hotel gets negative reviews.

The only security you have when on your own is a safe guard that goes around your neck, if youâ€™re in any danger youâ€™re supposed to hold the button for 4-60 seconds and it would connect to an operator who would speak to you and decide if emergency service would need calling out. I find this to be terrible because it wouldnâ€™t actually stop you from being harmed. A floor walk is required every two hours through the night which can be very terrifying. A tragic incident recently happened at a travelodge but there were barely any changes made to the safety of the staff since.
As for housekeeping staff, thereâ€™s no set finish time itâ€™s always you finish when you finish which is mostly between 2pm-4pm but can be as late as 7pm. Managers sometime expect you to achieve the impossible."
